Updated May 27th, 2024, from my home in Chennai.

It's hot and sunny today. Around 32 degrees celsius, but feels like 38 degrees celsius because of the humidity. 

<b></b>What I am doing now?</b>

- I just did my 55 minutes of CrossFit HIIT workout.
- I am having ginger tea, and will have protein shake after. My lunch will be eggs and vegetables. Simple. Nothing too fancy. I do not have breakfast and I do intermittent fasting 16:8.
- I have planned a few trades this week and will be executing them shortly after I write this document. 
- I am in the process of devising an algorithmic trading system, laced with python and excel. I am excited and looking forward to it. 
- I am currently reading "Leaving" by Roxana Robinson and "Quantitative Trading" by Ernest P Chan. I'm loving both so far.
- I have a client meet in the evening, where we will discuss asset allocation and investment ideas. 
- I am in the process of optimising my material possessions and getting rid of unwanted stuff, especially books which I will donate to a library or charity. Eventually, I would like to whittle down my possessions and live a minmimalist lifestyle. 
- I have enrolled for two medium-term courses: CTEP and CWM.
- I plan to update this document every week.
