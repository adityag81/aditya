# What I am doing now?

## Medium and Long-term goals ##

- I am in the process of devising an algorithmic trading system. I am learning python and advanced excel to supplement this process. I am excited and looking forward to it.
- My goal is to evolve my investment advisory practice and make it a passive source of income whilst keeping trading as an active income source. 
- I am in the process of optimising my material possessions and getting rid of unwanted stuff. Eventually, I would like to whittle down my possessions and live a minmimalist lifestyle.
- I am trying to get my golf handicap down to single digits. It is currently 14. I need to buy a driver though. 
- I hope to play tournament-level squash by end of the year. 
- Achieve lean body mass and single digit body-fat percentage.

## What I plan to do today ##
- I have to attend my friend's dad's 80th birthday function. It's a festive occasion in India to celebrate 60th and 80th birthdays.
- I have to prepare accounts for my family and file income taxes by this month end.
