Updated May 27th, 2024, from my home in Chennai.

It's hot and sunny today. Around 32 degrees celsius, but feels like 38 degrees celsius because of the humidity. 

# What I am doing now?

- I just did my 55 minutes of CrossFit HIIT workout. This is my long-term goal of achieving lean body mass and single digit body-fat percentage.
- I am having ginger tea, and will have protein shake after. My lunch will be eggs and vegetables. Simple. Nothing too fancy. I do not have breakfast and I do intermittent fasting 16:8.
- I am in the process of devising an algorithmic trading system. I am excited and looking forward to it.
- I am learning python and advanced excel to supplement my algorithmic trading. 
- I am currently reading "Leaving" by Roxana Robinson and "Quantitative Trading" by Ernest P Chan. I'm loving both so far.
- I will discuss asset allocation and investment ideas with my clients this week.  
- I am in the process of optimising my material possessions and getting rid of unwanted stuff, especially books which I will donate to a library or charity. Eventually, I would like to whittle down my possessions and live a minmimalist lifestyle. 
- I have enrolled for two medium-term courses: CTEP and CWM. My goal is to evolve my advisory practice and make it a passive source of income.
- I have to prepare accounts for my family and file income taxes by this month end.
