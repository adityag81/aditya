It's hot and sunny today. Around 32 degrees celsius, but feels like 38 degrees celsius because of the humidity.

# What I am doing now?

## Medium and Long-term goals ##

- I am in the process of devising an algorithmic trading system. I am learning python and advanced excel to supplement this process. I am excited and looking forward to it.
- My goal is to evolve my investment advisory practice and make it a passive source of income whilst keeping trading as an active income source. 
- I am in the process of optimising my material possessions and getting rid of unwanted stuff. Eventually, I would like to whittle down my possessions and live a minmimalist lifestyle.
- I am trying to get my golf handicap down to single digits. It is currently 14.
- I hope to play tournament-level squash by end of the year. 
- Achieve lean body mass and single digit body-fat percentage.

## What I did today ##
- I just did my 55 minutes of intense CrossFit HIIT workout. 
- I am having ginger tea, and will have protein shake after. My lunch will be eggs and vegetables. Simple. Nothing too fancy. I do not have breakfast and I do intermittent fasting 16:8.
- I will discuss asset allocation and investment ideas with my clients this week.  
- I have enrolled for two medium-term courses: CTEP and CWM to achieve my passive-income goal.
- I have to prepare accounts for my family and file income taxes by this month end.
